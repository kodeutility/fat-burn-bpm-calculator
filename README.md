# Desktop GUI Application using Python and PyQt5

Project is created using Python, Qt Designer and PyQt5. 
I hope it helps everyone who is starting out in the Python world by building a simple GUI application. 
This project works very well with Windows OS. It is NOT tested on linux and mac OS.

## Calculation of bpm

- The application takes age as input and calculates maximum heart rate and fat burning heart rate.
- Maximum heart rate is calculated using (206.9 - (0.67 * age))
- Target fat burning heart rate is calculated using (0.65 * maximum heart rate)
- Formulae are taken from **Med Sci Sports Exerc.** as mentioned in **"Data Structures and Algorithms in Python"** by 
*Michael T. Goodrich*, *Roberto Tamassia* and *Michael H. Goldwasser*
